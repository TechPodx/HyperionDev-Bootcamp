According to the output, we can observe below similarities

   - When the for loop iterates over "cat" and "monkey," the resulting similarity rate is 0.59299..., whereas when it compares "cat" to "apple," the similarity rate is lower at 0.20368...
   - The reason for the discrepancy in similarity rates between "cat" and "monkey" (0.59299...) and "cat" and "apple" (0.20368...) when the for loop is applied is due to the fact that spaCy recognizes "cat" and "monkey" as both being animals, while "cat" and "apple" are recognized as an animal and a fruit, respectively.
   - Similarly to the previous comparison, the similarity rate between "apple" and "banana" is higher at 0.664670... because spaCy recognizes both as fruits.
   - Based on the above results, the noteworthy observation is that the relationship rate between "monkey" and "banana" is as high as 0.404150, despite the objects being different. This demonstrates the model's ability to recognize practical real-world relationships between objects. However, we cannot observe a similar relationship between "cat" and "banana," or "cat" and "apple."
