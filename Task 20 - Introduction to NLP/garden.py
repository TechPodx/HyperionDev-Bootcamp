# ***** Comments about two entities *****

# PERSON - People, including fictional
# This entity refers to individuals or group of people, such as names of persons, family names or group names. 
# I do have a sense in terms of "Mary" recognised as a PERSON entity.

# GPE - Countries, cities, states
# This refers to geopolitical entities, such as countries, cities, states, or provinces
# This makes sense as it recognised Mississippi as a GPE entity as it is a state
